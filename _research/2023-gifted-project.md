## Summary
In Peru, it is estimated that between 8 and 10% of the population has high abilities, characterized by high levels of creative performance, achievement motivation, and intellectual potential in various areas. A frequent neuropsychological characteristic in these people is sensory hypersensitivity, observable from an early age. This phenomenon, associated with dysfunction in multisensory integration, has been linked to various clinical diagnoses such as schizophrenia, Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), sensory loss, and dyslexia. Despite this association, there are few empirical studies on multisensory integration in people with high abilities. This project seeks to explore auditory sensitivity and multisensory integration in university students with high abilities in Metropolitan Lima. 128 students will be selected, divided into two groups: 64 with high abilities and 64 control groups. Discrimination and auditory sensitivity will be assessed by audiometry with a professional audiometer, and multisensory integration using the two-flash illusion, adapted from the study by Cecere et al. (2015) and programmed in Psychopy v. 2021.2.3. The tests will be carried out at the Computational Cognitive Neuroscience Laboratory at PUCP, after informed consent and demographic data collection. The results will be analyzed by comparing the scores between both groups. The study aims to offer an initial insight into auditory sensitivity and multisensory integration in gifted students, which could help improve the development of their intellectual and creative abilities, and ultimately contribute to strengthening human potential in Peru.
