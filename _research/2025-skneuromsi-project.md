## Summary

<br/><img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/renatoparedes/scikit-neuromsi/main/res/logo_banner.png'>

Scikit-NeuroMSI is an open-source Python framework that simplifies the implementation of neurocomputational models of multisensory integration.

Research on the neural mechanisms underlying multisensory integration—where unisensory signals combine to produce distinct multisensory responses—has surged in recent years. Despite this progress, a unified theoretical framework for multisensory integration remains elusive. Scikit-NeuroMSI aims to bridge this gap by providing a standardised, flexible, and extensible platform for modelling multisensory integration, fostering the development of theories that connect neural and behavioural responses.
