## Summary
Research on the neural processes by which unisensory signals are combined to form a multisensory response has grown remarkably in the recent years. Nevertheless, there is as yet no computational modelling software that allows for explanations for different paradigms and levels of explanation in multisensory integration. We introduce Scikit-NeuroMSI, a Python framework for multisensory integration modelling aimed at fostering the creation of a unifying framework that narrows the gap between neural and behavioural multisensory responses.
