I participated in the CRECE Podcast, a digital initiative organized by the National Scholarship and Educational Credit Program (PRONABEC) of the Ministry of Education of Peru (MINEDU).

In this podcast, I recounted how my vocation for psychology and neuroscience was born, as well as the path taken to begin my research in computational neuroscience applied to psychiatry. In particular, I talk about my research on the peripersonal space in patients with schizophrenia.
