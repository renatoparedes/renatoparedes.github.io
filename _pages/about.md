I work as an Assistant Professor at the Department of Psychology of the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru (PUCP), where I lead the [Computational Cognitive Neuroscience Lab](https://www.instagram.com/neuropucp/).

I study the neural basis of cognition and behaviour in neurological and psychiatric conditions through experimental research and computational modelling. My main interest is multisensory integration processes underlying bodily self alterations. I also actively collaborate in the field of human-robot interaction, focusing on the validation of emerging technologies for mental health and education.

My work has been published in Biological Psychiatry: Cognitive Neuroscience and Neuroimaging and the International Journal of Social Robotics. I've also contributed to the book Human-Robot Interaction Evaluation Methods and Their Standardization, from the collection Springer Series on Bio- and Neurosystems. 

I was honored to receive the 2019 Cognitive Science MSc Dissertation Prize from the University of Edinburgh and the 2018 Excellence Scholarship “President of the Republic” from the Peruvian Ministry of Education.

I hold a BA in Psychology with a major in Educational Psychology from PUCP and an MSc in Cognitive Science from the University of Edinburgh (UK). Currently, I'm pursuing a PhD in Neuroscience at the National University of Cordoba (Argentina).
